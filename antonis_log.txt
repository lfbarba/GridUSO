list of changes by Antonis on 20.2.16:

1) said in several places input is a (m,n)-grid. That is wrong of course as any vertex query algorithm then would be linear to the input. The input is the oracle. Fixed. 

2) Command \join is replaced by $join$ so that the word join appears in italics. This is since it is an algorithmic operation.

3) Added acyclicity as Lemma 1.

4) Reformed the Appendix: 
*) Appendix A is "Missing proofs". 
*) Appendix B is "A deterministic lower bound". It now contains a discussion/proof that the USO we get by the lower bound theorem are Holt-Klee (and so the upper bound for HK is tight).
*) Appendix C is the discussion about why 

) Several typos here and there.
