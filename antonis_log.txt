list of changes by Antonis on 20.2.16:

1) said in several places input is a (m,n)-grid which is at least misleading, if not wrong. I rephrased such that it avoids this wording. When the input is an (a,b)-oracle it’s ok so I left it as is.

2) Command \join is replaced by $join$ so that the word join appears in italics. This is since it is an algorithmic operation.

3) Added acyclicity as Lemma 1.

4) Added a description of what does Holt-Klee mean in general and what that means for grids.

4) Reformed the Appendix: 
*) Appendix A is "Missing proofs". 
*) Appendix B is "A deterministic lower bound". It now contains a discussion/proof that the USO we get by the lower bound theorem are Holt-Klee (and so the upper bound for HK is tight).
*) Appendix C is the discussion about why the subsystem oracle does not exist. I try to do this without defining the shatter function.. hope it looks ok.

What about this “We believe that \sink is a good candidate for an LP-type problem where super-linear lower bounds might exist.” -> page 3
